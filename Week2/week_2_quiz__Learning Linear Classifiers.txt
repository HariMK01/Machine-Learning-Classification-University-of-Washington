Learning Linear Classifiers

6 questions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. 
(True/False) A linear classifier can only learn positive coefficients.

True

False
--------------------------------------------------------------------
FALSE [CORRECT]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. 
(True/False) In order to train a logistic regression model, we find the weights that maximize the likelihood of the model.

True

False
--------------------------------------------------------------------
TRUE [CORRECT]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. 
(True/False) The data likelihood is the product of the probability of the inputs x given the weights w and response y.

True

False
--------------------------------------------------------------------
FALSE [CORRECT]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. 
Questions 4 and 5 refer to the following scenario.

Consider the setting where our inputs are 1-dimensional. We have data

x	y
2.5	+1
0.3	-1
2.8	+1
0.5	+1
and the current estimates of the weights are w0=0 and w1=1. (w0: the intercept, w1: the weight for x).

Calculate the likelihood of this data. Round your answer to 2 decimal places.
