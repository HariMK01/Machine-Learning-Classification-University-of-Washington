8 questions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. 
In the function feature_derivative_with_L2, was the intercept term regularized?

Yes

No
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. 
Does the term with L2 regularization increase or decrease the log likelihood ℓℓ(w)?

Increases

Decreases

3. 
Which of the following words is not listed in either positive_words or negative_words?

love

disappointed

great

money

quality
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. 
Questions 5 and 6 use the coefficient plot of the words in positive_words and negative_words.

(True/False) All coefficients consistently get smaller in size as the L2 penalty is increased.

True

False

5. 
Questions 5 and 6 use the coefficient plot of the words in positive_words and negative_words.

(True/False) The relative order of coefficients is preserved as the L2 penalty is increased. (For example, if the coefficient for 'cat' was more positive than that for 'dog', this remains true as the L2 penalty increases.)

True

False
