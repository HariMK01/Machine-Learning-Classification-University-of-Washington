1. 
What percentage of the predictions on sample_validation_data did decision_tree_model get correct?

25%

50%

75%

100%

2. 
Which loan has the highest probability of being classified as a safe loan?

First

Second

Third

Fourth

3. 
Notice that the probability preditions are the exact same for the 2nd and 3rd loans. Why would this happen?

During tree traversal both examples fall into the same leaf node.

This can only happen with sheer coincidence.

How does the performance of big_model on the validation set compare to decision_tree_model on the validation set? Is this a sign of overfitting?

big_model has higher accuracy on the validation set than decision_tree_model. This is overfitting.

big_model has higher accuracy on the validation set than decision_tree_model. This is not overfitting.

big_model has lower accuracy on the validation set than decision_tree_model. This is overfitting.

big_model has lower accuracy on the validation set than decision_tree_model. This is not overfitting.

Let us assume that each mistake costs money:

Assume a cost of $10,000 per false negative.
Assume a cost of $20,000 per false positive.
What is the total cost of mistakes made by decision_tree_model on validation_data? Please enter your answer as a plain integer, without the dollar sign or the comma separator, e.g. 3002000.
