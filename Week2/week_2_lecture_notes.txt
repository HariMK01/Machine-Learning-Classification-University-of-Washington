Choosing step size

slide 43


compare convergence with different step sizes
- if step size is larger - early oscillation but gets better result at end.



https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification/lecture/MVzEy/careful-with-step-sizes-that-are-too-large

Careful with step sizes that are too large

if step size is too big, oscillations decrease but never quite converges?

"Rule of thumb for choosing step size"
slide 47

picking step size requires trial & error
try exponentially spaced step sizes.
find one step size that is too small - smooth but too slow to converge.
find one step size that is too large - oscilates too much.
