Hello, you can go through the following lecture for review of how to calculate weighted error

https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification/lecture/vR1RK/weighted-error

The answer basically involves the following steps

    Identify the majority class(which class has the higher total weight?) and predict that class as the label for all the data points.
    Calculate the sum of weights of data points where the the prediction made in step 1 is wrong.
    Calculate the sum of weights of all the data points.
    Calculate the weighted error. 

Feel free to reply if you need more help. All the best!
