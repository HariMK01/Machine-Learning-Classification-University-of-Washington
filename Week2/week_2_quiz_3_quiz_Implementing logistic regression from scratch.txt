1. 
How many reviews in amazon_baby_subset.gl contain the word perfect?

Enter answer here
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2955
see calc method in notebook.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. 
Consider the feature_matrix that was obtained by converting our data to NumPy format.

How many features are there in the feature_matrix?

Enter answer here
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
194
shape of feature_matrix = (53072L, 194L)
0th column is intercept which is a feature.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. 
Assuming that the intercept is present, how does the number of features in feature_matrix relate to the number of features in the logistic regression model? 
Let x = [number of features in feature_matrix] 
and y = [number of features in logistic regression model].

y = x - 1

y = x

y = x + 1

None of the above
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
y = x

As each iteration of gradient ascent passes, does the log-likelihood increase or decrease?

It increases.

It decreases.

None of the above
